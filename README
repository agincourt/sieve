    filter_by :name

      <div>

        <%= submit_tag 'Update Filters &raquo;', :name => nil %>
      </div>
    </fieldset>
  </form>

Advanced
========

The filter_by method currently supports the following options (usage: filter_by attribute_name, options = { })

* set (array)
  Pass an array of arrays, with field name and identifier e.g:
  :set => [ ['Complete', 'complete'], ['Open', 'open'] ]
  this will change the input field to a select box with the chosen options.

* collection (class or scope or array)
  Pass class, scope or array to which 'each' will be called to produce the same result as above.
  
* include_blank (string)
  Much like in the select form helper, you can opt to include a blank field at the top. The string
  will be displayed within the first option, e.g.:
  :include_blank => '-- Select One --' # output: <option value="">-- Select One --</option>
